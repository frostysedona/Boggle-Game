# Boggle-Game
 Loosely based on the classic board game, Boggle. The game loads in the dice from the file BoggleDiceCaps.txt and displays them to the user. The user presses any button to shake the board. The number of shakes defaults to 500, but can be modified easily by changeing the constant 
 integer `NUMBER_OF_SHAKES`. The user is prompted to enter a word. The program does not follow the traditional rules of Boggle. Instead, it only requires the characters of the word to be present on the board. The program does not terminate itself and must be closed manually.

### Below are just some of the funtionalities I used to create this program.
* Recursive array iteration
* Two-dimensional arrays
* Input/Output from terminal and external file
* Random number generation
* String iteration
